# video-to-text
a program who creates .mp4 text videos (muted)



step 1 - path to file
step 2 - frames per second (input shold be float between 1 and 0.infinity)
step 3 - output name
step 4 - colors: "y" will make a grid of 6x6 pixels (dots) and they will have a color, anything else will make the same, but whiout color

ps: if you have a file named frames, don't run in the same directory, all of its contents will be deleted (for video creation we stract images and then edit they)
and the program is not threaded, so it can take a while to end.
